###(2016-06-21) I would say that:
1. Openshift cannot support ES6 very well, so server side code changed to es5.
1. How does Openshift allow cors, do not know yet, so changed the related code.

###(2016-06-22) I have to say:
1. ...OK, never mind. 
1. Injected js and css into html, convertd img file to base64, hope it works better.
1. Changed report generate way to websocket, beg it works.
